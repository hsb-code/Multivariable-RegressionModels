This repository showcases the implementation of multivariable regression models using linear regression for housing price prediction and logistic regression for breast cancer classification. The project focuses on leveraging multiple features to build robust predictive models for real-world applications in the housing market and medical diagnostics.

Models Included
1. Linear Regression for Housing Price Prediction
- Objective: Predict housing prices based on multiple features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, location, etc.
- Features: Utilizes a dataset containing housing features and corresponding prices for training and evaluating the linear regression model.
- Evaluation: Employs metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared to assess the predictive performance of the model.
- Visualization: Includes visualizations of predicted vs. actual prices and feature importance.

3. Logistic Regression for Breast Cancer Classification
- Objective: Classify breast cancer cases as malignant or benign based on medical features like tumor size, age, histological type, etc.
- Features: Utilizes a dataset containing medical features and corresponding breast cancer labels for training and evaluating the logistic regression model.
- Evaluation: Utilizes metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to assess the classification performance.
- Visualization: Includes visualizations of ROC curves, confusion matrices, and feature coefficients.

Key Features
- Model Training: Demonstrates the process of training multivariable regression models using scikit-learn or similar libraries.
- Data Preprocessing: Includes data cleaning, feature scaling, and handling missing values to prepare the datasets for model training.
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Discusses techniques for tuning model hyperparameters such as regularization strength and polynomial degrees.
- Model Evaluation: Provides insights into evaluating model performance using appropriate evaluation metrics and cross-validation techniques.
- Real-world Applications: Highlights the practical use cases of multivariable regression models in the housing market and medical domain.
